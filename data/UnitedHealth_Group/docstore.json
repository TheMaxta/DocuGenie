Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the Journal. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty. On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution.On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.In June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class-action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).", "start_char_idx": 7697, "end_char_idx": 11561, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2afc994-cd19-4cc5-ab87-fb664e5966e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2afc994-cd19-4cc5-ab87-fb664e5966e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "hash": "055eadc6a1b453df8bcdd9f8012e3f620e5582220e28b86ba949539b8a64bcb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c1a2625-8ae3-41e0-8915-b0d0b9f9d651", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "hash": "18546bb82a3271ff7c18f32d7feda266f7e2c938ab61cc11232a7968029b22aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18395002-3dc0-4308-881f-68f6fbaf2049", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ee89eb445c22779e036e916d7f0ef43df3c99ec52c8bb232986e0fa85236d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== OptumInsight, aka Ingenix ====\nIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.On January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.On January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.On October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc.\n\n\n==== Investigations and lawsuits ====\n\n\n==== Medicare overbilling lawsuit ====\nA whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions \u2014 and likely billions \u2014 of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.\n\n\n==== Richard Cole, and others v.

Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against United Healthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"\n\n\n==== PacifiCare fine in California ====\nIn 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173 million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91 million in penalties.\n\n\n==== CMS fine over Medicare Part D ====\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.\n\n\n==== New Jersey fine in 2018 ====\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.\n\n\n==== Pennsylvania ====\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.\n\n\n==== Northern California ====\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.", "start_char_idx": 11564, "end_char_idx": 15867, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18395002-3dc0-4308-881f-68f6fbaf2049": {"__data__": {"id_": "18395002-3dc0-4308-881f-68f6fbaf2049", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "hash": "055eadc6a1b453df8bcdd9f8012e3f620e5582220e28b86ba949539b8a64bcb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2afc994-cd19-4cc5-ab87-fb664e5966e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "hash": "f08631a55e1953d21ebeb82583467f1d13ea6f2dd61d06876b01a79e9b6153db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5a64c96-d530-42b9-ad5f-399757c7aa41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f3fbdcc66623dd1b60fdad807b5c238c4aed32ab08f3f5ade249eeed85e0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== CMS fine over Medicare Part D ====\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.\n\n\n==== New Jersey fine in 2018 ====\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.\n\n\n==== Pennsylvania ====\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.\n\n\n==== Northern California ====\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.\n\n\n==== Policy Research ownership ====\nThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides an economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.\nThe organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.\nThe Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.\nThe Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its website. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals. For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act. Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.\nSeveral Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"However, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told The Washington Post that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"\n\n\n==== Influencing the research of Yale University economist Zack Cooper ====\nIn August 2021, a report from The Intercept revealed that UnitedHealthcare worked behind the scenes to guide Yale University healthcare economist Zack Cooper's research on surprise medical billing. United provided Cooper with anonymous data and made edits to his paper, which blamed physician networks TeamHealth and EmCare for the rise in balance billing. United Health Network CEO Dan Rosenthal later confirmed United's work with Cooper during a deposition in a lawsuit filed against United by TeamHealth. Cooper's work was presented as independent, unbiased academic research before Congress, the White House, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and numerous media reports.\n\n\n==== Underpaying physicians ====\nIn late 2021, Tennessee-based physician network TeamHealth sued UnitedHealthcare in the 8th District Court of Clark County, Nevada, alleging the insurer underpaid claims to three of TeamHealth's Nevada-based affiliates. In November 2021, the jury unanimously found United guilty of \"oppression, fraud, and malice\" in its conduct and awarded TeamHealth $2.65 million in compensatory damages. In December, the jury reconvened to determine punitive damages and awarded TeamHealth $60 million. TeamHealth plans to pursue similar legal action against United and other insurers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n\n\n==== Change Healthcare ====\nIn February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare cost. The Justice Department said that UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana, Anthem Inc, CVS Health, Aetna, and Cigna. A U.S. judge rejected the department's bid in September. Following completion of the acquisition in October 2022, the parties agreed that the appeal would be voluntarily dismissed, with the Justice Department not providing reasons for dropping the appeal.", "start_char_idx": 15288, "end_char_idx": 20062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5a64c96-d530-42b9-ad5f-399757c7aa41": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5a64c96-d530-42b9-ad5f-399757c7aa41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "hash": "055eadc6a1b453df8bcdd9f8012e3f620e5582220e28b86ba949539b8a64bcb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18395002-3dc0-4308-881f-68f6fbaf2049", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}, "hash": "2fe814a54e3a5200646c21af313bc23750cb49a28aa169d50ef5cde4cee1e071", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Change Healthcare ====\nIn February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare cost.

UnitedHealth has been accused by a whistle blower, accused of fraud by the U.S. government and over-billed according to the Inspector General. Executives at UnitedHealth Group told  workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses, to identify diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed, inflating bills paid by the federal government's Medicare Advantage program.A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2021, Medicare Advantage programs provided insurers with double the gross margin than insurance for individuals, groups, or Medicaid Managed Care.\n\n\n== Foundations ==\nFoundations affiliated with UnitedHealth Group include the United Health Foundation (UHF) and the UnitedHealthcare Children's Foundation (UHCCF), both of which were established in 1999.UHF pledged $100 million over ten years to fund scholarships and workforce development programs focused on increasing ethnic and racial diversity within the health care industry.UHCCF administers grants to help pay for medical costs for families with coverage gaps. According to UHCCF, the foundation raises money for medical grants by selling gift items such as backpacks, books, cards, and games, some of which are created by children.UHF's investment will support 10,000 physicians from unrepresented communities: 5,000 students with a primary care focus and 5,000 physicians advancing in mental health, nursing, midwifery, medicine. The work of this fund is part of a global initiative in which UnitedHealth Group has teamed up with nine organizations to provide scholarships to more than 3,000 international students through the Diverse Scholars Initiative.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerica's Health Rankings (reports released annually in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group's United Health Foundation since 1990)\n2024 Change Healthcare ransomware attack\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nBusiness data for UnitedHealth Group Incorporated: \nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated recipient profile on USAspending.gov", "start_char_idx": 19353, "end_char_idx": 22267, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"191d17b3-1790-47a7-93f7-c74fdb6f9dce": {"doc_hash": "d989eee98ecd870764e14c28e20e8d0509833ba8f454a2b07f5a6939feb6123e", "ref_doc_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865"}, "642271e3-b45f-4159-b46d-e94c1dca3d2f": {"doc_hash": "960373e1343541a9b9595a9296d1e8b8d376ae4bf0fc41ebd62d6d66d6b0c6f5", "ref_doc_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865"}, "6c1a2625-8ae3-41e0-8915-b0d0b9f9d651": {"doc_hash": "18546bb82a3271ff7c18f32d7feda266f7e2c938ab61cc11232a7968029b22aa", "ref_doc_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865"}, "c2afc994-cd19-4cc5-ab87-fb664e5966e9": {"doc_hash": "f08631a55e1953d21ebeb82583467f1d13ea6f2dd61d06876b01a79e9b6153db", "ref_doc_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865"}, "18395002-3dc0-4308-881f-68f6fbaf2049": {"doc_hash": "2fe814a54e3a5200646c21af313bc23750cb49a28aa169d50ef5cde4cee1e071", "ref_doc_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865"}, "f5a64c96-d530-42b9-ad5f-399757c7aa41": {"doc_hash": "6220b7262cd2243ceda589c8d58b54b8fe4234c3e5947a19c1730448eec1cdfb", "ref_doc_id": "5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"5ef78fcd-aa2d-42a2-a7bc-6297301d8865": {"node_ids": ["191d17b3-1790-47a7-93f7-c74fdb6f9dce", "642271e3-b45f-4159-b46d-e94c1dca3d2f", "6c1a2625-8ae3-41e0-8915-b0d0b9f9d651", "c2afc994-cd19-4cc5-ab87-fb664e5966e9", "18395002-3dc0-4308-881f-68f6fbaf2049", "f5a64c96-d530-42b9-ad5f-399757c7aa41"], "metadata": {"file_path": "data/UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_name": "UnitedHealth_Group.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22287, "creation_date": "2024-03-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-24"}}}}
