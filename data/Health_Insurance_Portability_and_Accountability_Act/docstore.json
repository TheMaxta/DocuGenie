It aimed to alter the transfer of healthcare information, stipulated the guidelines by which personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage. It generally prohibits healthcare providers and businesses called covered entities from disclosing protected information to anyone other than a patient and the patient's authorized representatives without their consent. The bill does not restrict patients from receiving information about themselves (with limited exceptions). Furthermore, it does not prohibit patients from voluntarily sharing their health information however they choose, nor does it require confidentiality where a patient discloses medical information to family members, friends or other individuals not employees of a covered entity.\nThe act consists of 5 titles:\n\nTitle I protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs.\nTitle II, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.\nTitle III sets guidelines for pre-tax medical spending accounts.\nTitle IV sets guidelines for group health plans.\nTitle V governs company-owned life insurance policies.\n\n\n== Titles ==\nThere are five sections to the act, known as titles.\n\n\n=== Title I: Health Care Access, Portability, and Renewability ===\nTitle I of HIPAA regulates the availability and breadth of group health plans and certain individual health insurance policies. It amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, Title I addresses the issue of \"job lock\" which is the inability for an employee to leave their job because they would lose their health coverage. To combat the job lock issue, the Title protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families if they lose or change their jobs.Title I requires the coverage of and also limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for preexisting conditions. Group health plans may refuse to provide benefits in relation to preexisting conditions for either 12 months following enrollment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrollment. Title I allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by the amount of time that they have had \"creditable coverage\" before enrolling in the plan and after any \"significant breaks\" in coverage. \"Creditable coverage\" is defined quite broadly and includes nearly all group and individual health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. A \"significant break\" in coverage is defined as any 63-day period without any creditable coverage. Along with an exception, it allows employers to tie premiums or co-payments to tobacco use, or body mass index.\nTitle I mandates that insurance providers must issue policies without exclusions to individuals leaving group health plans, provided they have maintained continuous, credible coverage. (see above) exceeding 18 months, and renew individual policies for as long as they are offered or provide alternatives to discontinued plans for as long as the insurer stays in the market without exclusion regardless of health condition.\nSome health care plans are exempted from Title I requirements, such as long-term health plans and limited-scope plans like dental or vision plans offered separately from the general health plan. However, if such benefits are part of the general health plan, then HIPAA still applies to such benefits. For example, if the new plan offers dental benefits, then it must count creditable continuous coverage under the old health plan towards any of its exclusion periods for dental benefits.\nAn alternate method of calculating creditable continuous coverage is available to the health plan under Title I. That is, 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately, including dental and vision coverage. Anything not under those 5 categories must use the general calculation (e.g., the beneficiary may be counted with 18 months of general coverage, but only 6 months of dental coverage, because the beneficiary did not have a general health plan that covered dental until 6 months prior to the application date). Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health plan cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans, such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages.\nHidden exclusion periods are not valid under Title I (e.g., \"The accident, to be covered, must have occurred while the beneficiary was covered under this exact same health insurance contract\"). Such clauses must not be acted upon by the health plan. Also, they must be re-written so they can comply with HIPAA.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5338, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcde1455-9563-4cf8-8660-af973f999383": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcde1455-9563-4cf8-8660-af973f999383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd86f4de-a787-4089-958b-c9f9afedc3c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "172266842191b3b1d3719e17efaa7bd75407eb0244a54e2236dcfd32ad1ce1a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8232869d-3407-47b3-b0de-0d81f4a0a5a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "f09d02ed16eaac39c287b226aa17e655942af82165423b8afa1a14808d1256a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b98b72c-64b8-4352-adab-1cb82024d741", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5259461700144fe654301156be389d9d764c699ae321df7a8c8615445f5476a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Title II: Preventing Health Care Fraud and Abuse; Administrative Simplification; Medical Liability Reform ===\nTitle II of HIPAA establishes policies and procedures for maintaining the privacy and the security of individually identifiable health information, outlines numerous offenses relating to health care, and establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations. It also creates several programs to control fraud and abuse within the health-care system. However, the most significant provisions of Title II are its Administrative Simplification rules. Title II requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase the efficiency of the health-care system by creating standards for the use and dissemination of health-care information.These rules apply to \"covered entities\", as defined by HIPAA and the HHS. Covered entities include health plans, health care clearinghouses (such as billing services and community health information systems), and health care providers that transmit health care data in a way regulated by HIPAA.Per the requirements of Title II, the HHS has promulgated five rules regarding Administrative Simplification: the Privacy Rule,  the Transactions and Code Sets Rule, the Security Rule, the Unique Identifiers Rule, and the Enforcement Rule.\n\n\n==== Privacy Rule ====\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule is composed of national regulations for the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) in healthcare treatment, payment and operations by \"covered entities\" (generally, health care clearinghouses, employer-sponsored health plans, health insurers, and medical service providers that engage in certain transactions).The Privacy Rule came into effect on April 14, 2003, with a one-year extension for certain \"small plans\". By regulation, the HHS extended the HIPAA privacy rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of \"business associates\". PHI is any information that is held by a covered entity regarding health status, provision of health care, or health care payment that can be linked to any individual. This is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of an individual's medical record or payment history. Covered entities must disclose PHI to the individual within 30 days upon request. They must also disclose PHI when required to do so by law such as reporting suspected child abuse to state child welfare agencies.Covered entities may disclose protected health information to law enforcement officials for law enforcement purposes as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, subpoenas) and administrative requests; or to identify or locate a suspect, a fugitive, a material witness, or a missing person.A covered entity may disclose PHI to certain parties to facilitate treatment, payment, or health care operations without a patient's express written authorization. Any other disclosures of PHI require the covered entity to obtain written authorization from the individual for disclosure. In any case, when a covered entity discloses any PHI, it must make a reasonable effort to disclose only the minimum necessary information required to achieve its purpose.The Privacy Rule gives individuals the right to request a covered entity to correct any inaccurate PHI. Also, it requires covered entities to take some reasonable steps on ensuring the confidentiality of communications with individuals. For example, an individual can ask to be called at their work number instead of home or cell phone numbers.\nThe Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of uses of their PHI. Covered entities must also keep track of disclosures of PHI and document privacy policies and procedures. They must appoint a Privacy Official and a contact person responsible for receiving complaints and train all members of their workforce in procedures regarding PHI.An individual who believes that the Privacy Rule is not being upheld can file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In 2006 the Wall Street Journal reported that the OCR had a long backlog and ignores most complaints. \"Complaints of privacy violations have been piling up at the Department of Health and Human Services. Between April of 2003 and November 2006, the agency fielded 23,886 complaints related to medical-privacy rules, but it has not yet taken any enforcement actions against hospitals, doctors, insurers or anyone else for rule violations. A spokesman for the agency says it has closed three-quarters of the complaints, typically because it found no violation or after it provided informal guidance to the parties involved.\" However, in July 2011, the University of California, Los Angeles agreed to pay $865,500 in a settlement regarding potential HIPAA violations. An HHS Office for Civil Rights investigation showed that from 2005 to 2008, unauthorized employees repeatedly and without legitimate cause looked at the electronic protected health information of numerous UCLAHS patients.It is a misconception that the Privacy Rule creates a right for any individual to refuse to disclose any health information (such as chronic conditions or immunization records) if requested by an employer or business. HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements merely place restrictions on disclosure by covered entities and their business associates without the consent of the individual whose records are being requested; they do not place any restrictions upon requesting health information directly from the subject of that information.", "start_char_idx": 5341, "end_char_idx": 10928, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b98b72c-64b8-4352-adab-1cb82024d741": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b98b72c-64b8-4352-adab-1cb82024d741", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd86f4de-a787-4089-958b-c9f9afedc3c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "172266842191b3b1d3719e17efaa7bd75407eb0244a54e2236dcfd32ad1ce1a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcde1455-9563-4cf8-8660-af973f999383", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "7cbc30f77aec4a658653e3b703bab822172048a5b50eef9617a8020b36b2ee00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "096ffbf0-0f40-4471-8b8f-59ee800f903e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f0a1fe0e01f2c862ecf609bf23269f54bd312fc54162acbd27a7ede0592de20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "===== 2013 Final Omnibus Rule update =====\nIn January 2013, HIPAA was updated via the Final Omnibus Rule. The updates included changes to the Security Rule and Breach Notification portions of the HITECH Act. The most significant changes related to the expansion of requirements to include business associates, where only covered entities had originally been held to uphold these sections of the law.In addition, the definition of \"significant harm\" to an individual in the analysis of a breach was updated to provide more scrutiny to covered entities with the intent of disclosing breaches that previously were unreported. Previously, an organization needed proof that harm had occurred whereas now organizations must prove that harm had not occurred.\nProtection of PHI was changed from indefinite to 50 years after death. More severe penalties for violation of PHI privacy requirements were also approved.The HIPAA Privacy rule may be waived during disasters. Limited waivers have been issued in cases such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\n\n====== HITECH Act: privacy requirements ======\nSee the Privacy section of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act).\n\n\n===== Right to access one's PHI =====\nThe Privacy Rule requires medical providers to give individuals access to their PHI. After an individual requests information in writing (typically using the provider's form for this purpose), a provider has up to 30 days to provide a copy of the information to the individual. An individual may request the information in electronic form or hard-copy, and the provider is obligated to attempt to conform to the requested format. For providers using an electronic health record (EHR) system that is certified using CEHRT (Certified Electronic Health Record Technology) criteria, individuals must be allowed to obtain the PHI in electronic form. Providers are encouraged to provide the information expediently, especially in the case of electronic record requests.\nIndividuals have the broad right to access their health-related information, including medical records, notes, images, lab results, and insurance and billing information. Explicitly excluded are the private psychotherapy notes of a provider, and information gathered by a provider to defend against a lawsuit.Providers can charge a reasonable amount that relates to their cost of providing the copy, however, no charge is allowable when providing data electronically from a certified EHR using the \"view, download, and transfer\" feature which is required for certification. When delivered to the individual in electronic form, the individual may authorize delivery using either encrypted or unencrypted email, delivery using media (USB drive, CD, etc., which may involve a charge), direct messaging (a secure email technology in common use in the healthcare industry), or possibly other methods. When using unencrypted email, the individual must understand and accept the risks to privacy using this technology (the information may be intercepted and examined by others). Regardless of delivery technology, a provider must continue to fully secure the PHI while in their system and can deny the delivery method if it poses additional risk to PHI while in their system.An individual may also request (in writing) that their PHI is delivered to a designated third party such as a family care provider.\nAn individual may also request (in writing) that the provider send PHI to a designated service used to collect or manage their records, such as a Personal Health Record application. For example, a patient can request in writing that her ob-gyn provider digitally transmit records of her latest prenatal visit to a pregnancy self-care app that she has on her mobile phone.\n\n\n===== Disclosure to relatives =====\nAccording to their interpretations of HIPAA, hospitals will not reveal information over the phone to relatives of admitted patients. This has, in some instances, impeded the location of missing persons. After the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 San Francisco crash, some hospitals were reluctant to disclose the identities of passengers that they were treating, making it difficult for Asiana and the relatives to locate them. In one instance, a man in Washington state was unable to obtain information about his injured mother.Janlori Goldman, director of the advocacy group Health Privacy Project, said that some hospitals are being \"overcautious\" and misapplying the law, the Times reports. Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., has interpreted a federal regulation that requires hospitals to allow patients to opt out of being included in the hospital directory as meaning that patients want to be kept out of the directory unless they specifically say otherwise. As a result, if a patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to choose to be included in the directory, relatives and friends might not be able to find them, Goldman said.\n\n\n==== Transactions and Code Sets Rule ====\nHIPAA was intended to make the health care system in the United States more efficient by standardizing health care transactions. HIPAA added a new Part C titled \"Administrative Simplification\" to Title XI of the Social Security Act. This is supposed to simplify healthcare transactions by requiring all health plans to engage in health care transactions in a standardized way.", "start_char_idx": 10931, "end_char_idx": 16296, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "096ffbf0-0f40-4471-8b8f-59ee800f903e": {"__data__": {"id_": "096ffbf0-0f40-4471-8b8f-59ee800f903e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd86f4de-a787-4089-958b-c9f9afedc3c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "172266842191b3b1d3719e17efaa7bd75407eb0244a54e2236dcfd32ad1ce1a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b98b72c-64b8-4352-adab-1cb82024d741", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "17a1bf3e6eafb2ecafeb5b4b2eefd096797371545c4ed90dbdfff3568cd3ce4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78b66e81-a678-489a-a0f8-21fa8f87073b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7520cd2d01b5031f067a65a3193ed6ea54501ec9fa4cafd30db0c93262339e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "==== Transactions and Code Sets Rule ====\nHIPAA was intended to make the health care system in the United States more efficient by standardizing health care transactions. HIPAA added a new Part C titled \"Administrative Simplification\" to Title XI of the Social Security Act. This is supposed to simplify healthcare transactions by requiring all health plans to engage in health care transactions in a standardized way.\nThe HIPAA/EDI (electronic data interchange) provision was scheduled to take effect from October 16, 2003, with a one-year extension for certain \"small plans\". However, due to widespread confusion and difficulty in implementing the rule, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted a one-year extension to all parties. On January 1, 2012, newer versions, ASC X12 005010 and NCPDP D.0 become effective, replacing the previous ASC X12 004010 and NCPDP 5.1 mandate. The ASC X12 005010 version provides a mechanism allowing the use of ICD-10-CM as well as other improvements.\nUnder HIPAA, HIPAA-covered health plans are now required to use standardized HIPAA electronic transactions. See, 42 USC \u00a7 1320d-2 and 45 CFR Part 162. Information about this can be found in the final rule for HIPAA electronic transaction standards (74 Fed. Reg. 3296, published in the Federal Register on January 16, 2009), and on the CMS website.The EDI Health Care Claim Transaction Set (837) is used to submit health care claim billing information, encounter information, or both, except for retail pharmacy claims (see EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction). It can be sent from providers of health care services to payers, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit health care claims and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of health care services within a specific health care/insurance industry segment.\nFor example, a state mental health agency may mandate all healthcare claims, Providers and health plans who trade professional (medical) health care claims electronically must use the 837 Health Care Claim: Professional standard to send in claims. As there are many different business applications for the Health Care claim, there can be slight derivations to cover off claims involving unique claims such as for institutions, professionals, chiropractors, dentists, etc.\nEDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction (NCPDP Telecommunications is used to submit retail pharmacy claims to payers by health care professionals who dispense medications, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit claims for retail pharmacy services and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of retail pharmacy services within the pharmacy health care/insurance industry segment.\nThe EDI Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Transaction Set (835) can be used to make a payment, send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB), send an Explanation of Payments (EOP) remittance advice, or make a payment and send an EOP remittance advice only from a health insurer to a health care provider either directly or via a financial institution.\nThe EDI Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance Set (834) can be used by employers, unions, government agencies, associations or insurance agencies to enroll members to a payer.

The Security Rule complements the Privacy Rule. While the Privacy Rule pertains to all Protected Health Information (PHI) including paper and electronic, the Security Rule deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). It lays out three types of security safeguards required for compliance: administrative, physical, and technical. For each of these types, the Rule identifies various security standards, and for each standard, it names both required and addressable implementation specifications. Required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the Rule. Addressable specifications are more flexible. Individual covered entities can evaluate their own situation and determine the best way to implement addressable specifications. Some privacy advocates have argued that this \"flexibility\" may provide too much latitude to covered entities. Software tools have been developed to assist covered entities in the risk analysis and remediation tracking. The standards and specifications are as follows:\n\nAdministrative Safeguards \u2013 policies and procedures designed to clearly show how the entity will comply with the act\nCovered entities (entities that must comply with HIPAA requirements) must adopt a written set of privacy procedures and designate a privacy officer to be responsible for developing and implementing all required policies and procedures.\nThe policies and procedures must reference management oversight and organizational buy-in to compliance with the documented security controls.\nProcedures should clearly identify employees or classes of employees who have access to electronic protected health information (EPHI). Access to EPHI must be restricted to only those employees who have a need for it to complete their job function.\nThe procedures must address access authorization, establishment, modification, and termination.\nEntities must show that an appropriate ongoing training program regarding the handling of PHI is provided to employees performing health plan administrative functions.\nCovered entities that out-source some of their business processes to a third party must ensure that their vendors also have a framework in place to comply with HIPAA requirements.", "start_char_idx": 19805, "end_char_idx": 25227, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61e9463f-1deb-46fc-b07a-206de8aa139c": {"__data__": {"id_": "61e9463f-1deb-46fc-b07a-206de8aa139c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd86f4de-a787-4089-958b-c9f9afedc3c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "172266842191b3b1d3719e17efaa7bd75407eb0244a54e2236dcfd32ad1ce1a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "78b66e81-a678-489a-a0f8-21fa8f87073b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "a7ca502497180f276d794028340a4f0f50a0851a5931f9d5d7842ec3cecf737f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cda780e9-31e9-4ef6-bf18-31fe59291b4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6d1b5c30c40ccb62ef7bc20d422e6fdb374b10b416c8cafd5c445d2f39bb3ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The policies and procedures must reference management oversight and organizational buy-in to compliance with the documented security controls.\nProcedures should clearly identify employees or classes of employees who have access to electronic protected health information (EPHI).

Companies typically gain this assurance through clauses in the contracts stating that the vendor will meet the same data protection requirements that apply to the covered entity. Care must be taken to determine if the vendor further out-sources any data handling functions to other vendors and monitor whether appropriate contracts and controls are in place.\nA contingency plan should be in place for responding to emergencies. Covered entities are responsible for backing up their data and having disaster recovery procedures in place. The plan should document data priority and failure analysis, testing activities, and change control procedures.\nInternal audits play a key role in HIPAA compliance by reviewing operations with the goal of identifying potential security violations. Policies and procedures should specifically document the scope, frequency, and procedures of audits. Audits should be both routine and event-based.\nProcedures should document instructions for addressing and responding to security breaches that are identified either during the audit or the normal course of operations.\nPhysical Safeguards \u2013 controlling physical access to protect against inappropriate access to protected data\nControls must govern the introduction and removal of hardware and software from the network. (When equipment is retired it must be disposed of properly to ensure that PHI is not compromised.)\nAccess to equipment containing health information should be carefully controlled and monitored.\nAccess to hardware and software must be limited to properly authorized individuals.\nRequired access controls consist of facility security plans, maintenance records, and visitor sign-in and escorts.\nPolicies are required to address proper workstation use. Workstations should be removed from high traffic areas and monitor screens should not be in direct view of the public.\nIf the covered entities utilize contractors or agents, they too must be fully trained on their physical access responsibilities.\nTechnical Safeguards \u2013 controlling access to computer systems and enabling covered entities to protect communications containing PHI transmitted electronically over open networks from being intercepted by anyone other than the intended recipient.\nInformation systems housing PHI must be protected from intrusion. When information flows over open networks, some form of encryption must be utilized. If closed systems/networks are utilized, existing access controls are considered sufficient and encryption is optional.\nEach covered entity is responsible for ensuring that the data within its systems has not been changed or erased in an unauthorized manner.\nData corroboration, including the use of a checksum, double-keying, message authentication, and digital signature may be used to ensure data integrity.\nCovered entities must also authenticate entities with which they communicate. Authentication consists of corroborating that an entity is who it claims to be. Examples of corroboration include password systems, two or three-way handshakes, telephone callback, and token systems.\nCovered entities must make documentation of their HIPAA practices available to the government to determine compliance.\nIn addition to policies and procedures and access records, information technology documentation should also include a written record of all configuration settings on the components of the network because these components are complex, configurable, and always changing.\nDocumented risk analysis and risk management programs are required. Covered entities must carefully consider the risks of their operations as they implement systems to comply with the act. (The requirement of risk analysis and risk management implies that the act's security requirements are a minimum standard and places responsibility on covered entities to take all reasonable precautions necessary to prevent PHI from being used for non-health purposes.)", "start_char_idx": 24392, "end_char_idx": 29165, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cda780e9-31e9-4ef6-bf18-31fe59291b4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cda780e9-31e9-4ef6-bf18-31fe59291b4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd86f4de-a787-4089-958b-c9f9afedc3c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "172266842191b3b1d3719e17efaa7bd75407eb0244a54e2236dcfd32ad1ce1a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61e9463f-1deb-46fc-b07a-206de8aa139c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_name": "Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40201, "creation_date": "2024-03-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-25"}, "hash": "d36b39abe4db858610f4f8e44574faac1d40c29e2a7923fd2a315773adc91c44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6e25d79-286d-4c6c-b694-aa20dd0e4083", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afa011640198d1d41e8f534eb900f452bbdeaa276389e88751f45111f450631b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Covered entities must also authenticate entities with which they communicate.

Small health plans must use only the NPI by May 23, 2008.\nEffective from May 2006 (May 2007 for small health plans), all covered entities using electronic communications (e.g., physicians, hospitals, health insurance companies, and so forth) must use a single new NPI. The NPI replaces all other identifiers used by health plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs. However, the NPI does not replace a provider's DEA number, state license number, or tax identification number. The NPI is 10 digits (may be alphanumeric), with the last digit being a checksum. The NPI cannot contain any embedded intelligence; in other words, the NPI is simply a number that does not itself have any additional meaning. The NPI is unique and national, never re-used, and except for institutions, a provider usually can have only one. An institution may obtain multiple NPIs for different \"sub-parts\" such as a free-standing cancer center or rehab facility.\n\n\n==== Enforcement Rule ====\nOn February 16, 2006, HHS issued the Final Rule regarding HIPAA enforcement. It became effective on March 16, 2006. The Enforcement Rule sets civil money penalties for violating HIPAA rules and establishes procedures for investigations and hearings for HIPAA violations. For many years there were few prosecutions for violations.\nThis may have changed with the fining of $50,000 to the Hospice of North Idaho (HONI) as the first entity to be fined for a potential HIPAA Security Rule breach affecting fewer than 500 people. Rachel Seeger, a spokeswoman for HHS, stated, \"HONI did not conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis to the confidentiality of ePHI [electronic Protected Health Information] as part of its security management process from 2005 through Jan. 17, 2012.\" This investigation was initiated with the theft from an employees vehicle of an unencrypted laptop containing 441 patient records.\n\nAs of March 2013, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has investigated over 19,306 cases that have been resolved by requiring changes in privacy practice or by corrective action. If noncompliance is determined by HHS, entities must apply corrective measures. Complaints have been investigated against many different types of businesses such as national pharmacy chains, major health care centers, insurance groups, hospital chains and other small providers. There were 9,146 cases where the HHS investigation found that HIPAA was followed correctly. There were 44,118 cases that HHS did not find eligible cause for enforcement; for example, a violation that started before HIPAA started; cases withdrawn by the pursuer; or an activity that does not actually violate the Rules.\n\n\n=== Title III: Tax-related health provisions governing medical savings accounts ===\nTitle III standardizes the amount that may be saved per person in a pre-tax medical savings account.

It also repeals the financial institution rule to interest allocation rules. Finally, it amends provisions of law relating to people who give up United States citizenship or permanent residence, expanding the expatriation tax to be assessed against those deemed to be giving up their U.S. status for tax reasons, and making ex-citizens' names part of the public record through the creation of the Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate.\n\n\n== Effects on research and clinical care ==\nThe enactment of the Privacy and Security Rules has caused major changes in the way physicians and medical centers operate. The complex legalities and potentially stiff penalties associated with HIPAA, as well as the increase in paperwork and the cost of its implementation, were causes for concern among physicians and medical centers. An August 2006 article in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine detailed some such concerns over the implementation and effects of HIPAA.\n\n\n=== Effects on research ===\nHIPAA restrictions on researchers have affected their ability to perform retrospective, chart-based research as well as their ability to prospectively evaluate patients by contacting them for follow-up. A study from the University of Michigan demonstrated that implementation of the HIPAA Privacy rule resulted in a drop from 96% to 34% in the proportion of follow-up surveys completed by study patients being followed after a heart attack. Another study, detailing the effects of HIPAA on recruitment for a study on cancer prevention, demonstrated that HIPAA-mandated changes led to a 73% decrease in patient accrual, a tripling of time spent recruiting patients, and a tripling of mean recruitment costs.Under HIPAA, informed consent forms for research studies must document how protected health information will be kept private, potentially increasing barriers to participation.These data suggest that HIPAA privacy rules may have negative effects on the cost and quality of medical research. Dr. Kim Eagle, professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, was quoted in the Annals article as saying, \"Privacy is important, but research is also important for improving care. We hope that we will figure this out and do it right.\"\n\n\n=== Effects on clinical care ===\nThe complexity of HIPAA, combined with potentially stiff penalties for violators, can lead physicians and medical centers to withhold information from those who may have a right to it. A review of the implementation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that health care providers were \"uncertain about their legal privacy responsibilities and often responded with an overly guarded approach to disclosing information ... than necessary to ensure compliance with the Privacy rule\".

Examples of significant breaches of protected information and other HIPAA violations include:\n\nThe largest loss of data that affected 4.9 million people by Tricare Management of Virginia in 2011\nThe largest fines of $5.5 million levied against Memorial Healthcare Systems in 2017 for accessing confidential information of 115,143 patients and of $4.3 million levied against Cignet Health of Maryland in 2010 for ignoring patients' requests to obtain copies of their own records and repeated ignoring of federal officials' inquiries\nThe first criminal indictment was lodged in 2011 against a Virginia physician who shared information with a patient's employer \"under the false pretenses that the patient was a serious and imminent threat to the safety of the public, when in fact he knew that the patient was not such a threat.\"According to Koczkodaj et al., 2018, the total number of individuals affected since October 2009 is 173,398,820.\nThe differences between civil and criminal penalties are summarized in the following table:\n\n\n== Legislative information ==\nIn 1994, President Clinton expressed his goals to improve the healthcare system. However, his reforms did not succeed, most likely due to lack of support. The Congressional Quarterly Almanac of 1996 explains how two senators, Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Ted Kennedy (D-MA) came together and created a bill called the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 or more commonly known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill. This bill was stalled despite making it out of the Senate. In the 1996 State of the Union address, Clinton pressed the issue, and it resulted in bipartisan cooperation. After much debate and negotiation, there was a shift in momentum once a compromise between Kennedy and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer was accepted, after alterations were made of the original Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill. Soon after this, the bill was signed into law by President Clinton and was named the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\n\nPub.
