The Affordable Care Act (ACA): Also known as Obamacare, this law was enacted in 2010 to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, lower the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Medicare for All: This is a proposal to create a single-payer healthcare system in the United States, where the government would provide health insurance for all residents. It has been championed by several Democratic politicians, including Senator Bernie Sanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Health Care Choices Proposal: This is a proposal from conservative policy organizations that would replace the ACA with a system of block grants to states, which could be used to subsidize health insurance for low-income residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act: This is a proposal from House Democrats to expand the ACA by making more people eligible for subsidies, allowing the government to negotiate drug prices, and creating a public option for health insurance.\n",
